# odd_data_delay
An N-bit data stream is applied at the input (din), with new data arriving on every rising edge of the clock.
Even-indexed samples (0th, 2nd, 4th, 6th, …) appear immediately at the output (dout) in the same cycle.
Odd-indexed samples (1st, 3rd, 5th, …) are delayed by two clock cycles before appearing at the output.
